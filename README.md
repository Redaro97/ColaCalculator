# ColaCalculator
This is an extremely small file which contains the most popular soft drinks and calculates the price in INR.

# FAULTS:
1. The code is trashy. Prices keep changing and the prices are found through this: brand-of-cola * amount
2. It doesn't have an API to keep track of the fluctuating prices.
3. The code is bugged right now, and I have moved on to bigger projects.
4. The price is not in USD (United States Dollar), which is basically the standard currency in the world.

# PERKS:
If anybody can make the code better and makes this popular, I will give you the rights to manage this repository and project.

1. You can change this license.
2. You can promote this on your social media, and claim it's yours.
3. You can make this in another language like C++, JavaScript, etc.

Let's see if anybody even sees this.
